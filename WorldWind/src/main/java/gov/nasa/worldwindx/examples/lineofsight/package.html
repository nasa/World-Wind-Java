<p>Examples of how to perform line of sight calculations in WorldWind.</p>

<p>Line of sight calculations can use both terrain data and shapes. {@link
   gov.nasa.worldwindx.examples.lineofsight.LinesOfSight} shows how to find points that have line of sight to a given
   position. It is also possible to determine the intersection of a shape and an arbitrary line. {@link
   gov.nasa.worldwindx.examples.lineofsight.AbstractShapeIntersection} is an example of this type of calculation.</p>
