 * An interface for tactical graphics that depict routes: a series of point graphics connected by lines. For example,
 * the MIL-STD-2525 symbology set defines an Air Control Route that is composed of Air Control Points. The route is
 * composed of many tactical graphics, but it is treated as a single graphic. If the route is highlighted all of the
 * control points will also highlight, if the route is set invisible all the control points will be set invisible,
 * etc.
