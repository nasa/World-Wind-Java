/**
 * Common interface for renderables that are drawn on the Globe's surface terrain, such as {@link
 * gov.nasa.worldwind.render.SurfaceShape}. SurfaceObject implements the {@link gov.nasa.worldwind.render.Renderable}
 * and {@link gov.nasa.worldwind.render.PreRenderable} interfaces, so a surface object may be aggregated within any
 * layer or within some arbitrary rendering code.
 * <p/>
 * SurfaceObjects automatically aggregate themselves in the DrawContext's ordered surface renderable queue by calling
 * {@link gov.nasa.worldwind.render.DrawContext#addOrderedSurfaceRenderable(OrderedRenderable)} during the preRender,
 * pick, and render stages. This enables SurfaceObjects to be processed in bulk, and reduces texture memory consumption
 * by sharing rendering resources amongst multiple SurfaceObjects.
 * <p/>
 * Implementations of SurfaceObject require that {@link #preRender(DrawContext)} is called before {@link
 * #render(DrawContext)} and {@link #pick(DrawContext, java.awt.Point)}, and that preRender is called at the appropriate
 * stage in the current rendering cycle. Calling preRender locks in the SurfaceObject's visual appearance for any
 * subsequent calls to pick or render until the next call preRender.
