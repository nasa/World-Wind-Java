This document provides links on getting started with the World Wind Java SDK, provides instructions on running the
World Wind demo application, and outlines the key changes between each World Wind Java SDK release.

Getting Started With the World Wind Java SDK
============================================

Key files and folders in the World Wind Java SDK:
* build.xml: Apache ANT build file for the World Wind Java SDK.
* src: Contains all Java source files for the World Wind Java SDK, except the World Wind WMS Server.
* server: Contains the World Wind WMS Server Java source files, build file, and deployment files.
* lib-external/gdal: Contains the GDAL native binaries libraries that may optionally be distributed with World Wind.

Links to important World Wind sites that will help you get started using the World Wind Java SDK in your
application:

* [World Wind Main Website](http://worldwind.arc.nasa.gov/java/)
* [World Wind Forum](http://forum.worldwindcentral.com/forumdisplay.php?f=37)
* [World Wind API Documentation](http://builds.worldwind.arc.nasa.gov/worldwind-releases/1.3/docs/api/index.html)
* [World Wind Bug Base](http://issues.worldwind.arc.nasa.gov/secure/IssueNavigator.jspa?reset=true&pid=10021&status=1)


Running a Basic Demo Application
--------------------------------

To run the basic demo on Mac OS X or Linux:

1. Open a terminal.
2. cd to the World Wind release folder.
3. `chmod +x run-demo.bash`
4. `./run-demo.bash gov.nasa.worldwindx.examples.ApplicationTemplate`

To run the basic demo on Windows:

1. Open a command prompt.
2. cd to the World Wind release folder.
3. `run-demo.bat gov.nasa.worldwindx.examples.ApplicationTemplate`

Your computer must have a modern graphics card with an up-to-date driver.  The source of most getting-up-and-running
problems is an out-of-date graphics driver. To get an updated driver, visit your graphics card manufacturer's web site.
This will most likely be either NVIDIA, ATI or Intel. The drivers are typically under a link named _Downloads_ or
_Support_. If your computer is a laptop, then updated drivers are probably at the laptop manufacturer's web site rather
than the graphics card manufacturer's.

Using World Wind on Windows or Linux 64-bit
-------------------------------------------

To run World Wind on Windows with a 64-bit Java Virtual Machine, you must extract the 64-bit native libraries:

1. Open a terminal.
2. cd to the World Wind release folder.
3. `jar xf jogl-natives-windows-amd64.jar`
4. `jar xf gluegen-rt-natives-windows-amd64.jar`

This will replace the 32-bit JOGL libraries with 64-bit libraries.

64-bit libraries for Linux are not included with the release, but can be downloaded from:

* http://worldwind.arc.nasa.gov/java/jogl/webstart/jogl-natives-linux-amd64.jar
* http://worldwind.arc.nasa.gov/java/jogl/webstart/gluegen-rt-natives-linux-amd64.jar

Follow instructions above to extract the archives into the World Wind release folder.
