This document provides links on getting started with the World Wind Java SDK, provides instructions on running the a
World Wind demo application, and outlines the key changes between each World Wind Java SDK release.


Getting Started With the World Wind Java SDK
------------------------------------------------------------

Key files and folders in the World Wind Java SDK:
- build.xml: Apache ANT build file for the World Wind Java SDK.
- src: Contains all Java source files for the World Wind Java SDK, except the World Wind WMS Server.
- server: Contains the World Wind WMS Server Java source files, build file, and deployment files.
- lib-external/gdal: Contains the GDAL native binaries libraries that may optionally be distributed with World Wind.

application:

Running a Basic Demo Application
------------------------------------------------------------

To run the basic demo on Mac OS X or Linux:
    1) Open a terminal.
    2) cd to the World Wind release folder.
    3) chmod +x run-demo.bash
    4) ./run-demo.bash gov.nasa.worldwindx.examples.ApplicationTemplate

To run the basic demo on Windows:
    1) Open a command prompt.
    2) cd to the World Wind release folder.
    3) run-demo.bat gov.nasa.worldwindx.examples.ApplicationTemplate

Your computer must have a modern graphics card with an up-to-date driver.  The source of most getting-up-and-running
problems is an out-of-date graphics driver. To get an updated driver, visit your graphics card manufacturer's web site.
This will most likely be either NVIDIA, ATI or Intel. The drivers are typically under a link named "Downloads" or
"Support". If your computer is a laptop, then updated drivers are probably at the laptop manufacturer's web site rather
than the graphics card manufacturer's.
